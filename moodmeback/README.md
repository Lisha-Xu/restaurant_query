a. I use VUE to construct the front end, Nodejs, express to construct the backend, MongoDB as the database, and the project is developed to GCP.

b. We could search the restaurant name by filling the name blank in the first row. Then click search. If the name is in the database, the website will show the whole information of this restaurant. Otherwise, the website will show nothing.

c. If we don't use the name to search, please fill at least one blank (sort by (can't be "no require") or get <number> records)
  
d. If we just select one sort method, the whole data will show by the sort order. If "cuisine" is chosen, the records will show from the cuisine 'A' to 'Z'. If "average score" is chosen, the order of the records is the average score in each restaurant's grades (from high to low). If "most rated" is selected, the order of the records is the sum number of grades in each restaurant. (From high to low)
  
e. We can set how many records we want to get on each page. And we can set which page we want to look at. Don't fill in the page number unless we fill in the records number.
  
If there are any problems, please contact me.
